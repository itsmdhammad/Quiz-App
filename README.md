# Quiz-App
👨‍💻 I have developed a quiz app using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Some features are:

👉It record result and show on end with appropriate emojie.
👉During test, it shows that you clicked a wrong or right option with help of changing color of answers.

🙂 Note: I'm still learning, you can suggest me better approaches by overlooking code. Thanks.
